# G4ShapePredictor (G4SP)

This a Nix flake for G4SP, providing a dev shell with required dependencies.
I had some nightmares with anaconda so I made this.

## Running

```bash
nix develop -c python 'g4sp application code/G4ShapePredictor.py'
```

<!-- nix run github:Futarimiti/G4ShapePredictor -->
